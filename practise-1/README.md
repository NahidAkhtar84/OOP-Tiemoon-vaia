## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.6 or above**
2. **Pip (Python package manager)**
3. \`\`\*\* package\*\* (required for creating virtual environments on Debian/Ubuntu systems)

---

## Steps to Run the Project

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

### 1. Install `python3-venv`

This package is required to create a virtual environment on Debian/Ubuntu systems. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create an isolated virtual environment for the project using the command:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

This will create a directory named `venv` in the project folder, containing the isolated Python environment.

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment to use its isolated Python environment and dependencies.

- **On Linux/macOS:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows (PowerShell):**

  ```powershell
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate
  ```

Once activated, you should see the virtual environment's name (e.g., `venv`) in your terminal prompt.

### 4. Run the Project

Execute the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```
